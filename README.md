**NOTA BENE**

This is a work in progress and (as may be assumed reasonably enough) may be highly *unstable* just yet.

## Installation

At the moment we ship pre-release builds in the nightly channel _only_.

To use them you need to follow the [instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/managing-enterprise-plugin-repositories.html) of adding
additional plugin repository and paste the URL for the one you need:

    - Rust: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/nightly/8182
    - TOML: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/nightly/8195

See the [quick start](doc/QuickStart.md) and [tips & tricks](doc/Tips.md) for tutorial and screenshots!

*NOTA BENE*: To successfully import Cargo-backed project you will need Cargo
 from at least 1.8.0 toolchain.

As this is a preview release, something might go wrong. So, be brave to face some nasty bugs.

## Recent changes

We have completely reworked internal project representation to make plugin
compatible with all IntelliJ based IDEs. To migrate your project please remove
`.idea` and `*.iml` files and reopen it as described in the updated [quick
start](doc/QuickStart.md). The old guide is available
[here](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/blob/7caa46d2449935456a0e3e99154b6de0bede527d/doc/QuickStart.md).
